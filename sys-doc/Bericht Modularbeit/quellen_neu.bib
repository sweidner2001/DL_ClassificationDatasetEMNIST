  abstract     = {In this tutorial, we'll explore the seamless integration of Node-RED with the Mosquitto MQTT Broker, demonstrating how to set up Node-RED as both an MQTT Publisher and Subscriber. This powerful combination allows you to exchange data effortlessly between devices and applications in a secure and efficient manner.  🔗 Connect with MQTT Broker: We'll start by establishing a connection between Node-RED and the Mosquitto MQTT Broker. Learn how to configure the MQTT In and MQTT Out nodes to enable Node-RED to publish and subscribe to MQTT messages.  ⚙️ MQTT Publisher Setup: Discover the step-by-step process of configuring Node-RED to act as an MQTT Publisher. Follow along as we use the MQTT Out node to publish timestamps to the "Test" topic on the MQTT Broker. This functionality is invaluable for real-time data exchange in IoT and home automation projects.  🔄 MQTT Subscriber Setup: Next, delve into the MQTT In node setup within Node-RED to subscribe to messages from the "Test" topic on the Mosquitto MQTT Broker. Witness how Node-RED efficiently retrieves the timestamp data, creating a seamless communication channel between devices.  📈 Practical Application: Understand the practical implications of using Node-RED as both an MQTT Publisher and Subscriber. See how this setup can be applied to various projects, providing a flexible and scalable solution for your IoT and automation needs.  👩‍💻 Follow Along: Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial is designed for everyone. Follow the easy-to-understand instructions and enhance your skills in integrating Node-RED and MQTT for effective communication.  🔔 Don't forget to subscribe, like, and hit the notification bell to stay updated with our latest tutorials and tech insights!  ------------------------------------------------------------ 🌐Website : https://fusion-automate.super.site/ 💬Telegram: https://t.me/PYLIN 📞WhatsApp: https://wa.me/message/B7RXUT4OUXWUF1 📸Instagram:   / fusion\_automate   🗺Facebook:   / papercodein   💼LinkedIn:   / fusion-automate   👨‍💻GitHub: https://github.com/papercodeIN/ 📢Join this channel to get access to perks:    / @fusion\_automate   ------------------------------------------------------------},
